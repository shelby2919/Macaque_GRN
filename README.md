# Macaque regulatory network explorer

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/shelby2919/Macaque_GRN.git/main)

Interactive visualization of transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) and gene expression heatmaps.

This repository uses Jupyter notebooks to interactively visualize TRNs and gene expression heatmaps with [jp_gene_viz](https://github.com/simonsfoundation/jp_gene_viz)

In order to run the notebook, perform the following actions:
1) Click on launch binder button at top of README section on this page
2) Navigate to Notebooks folder from home folder
3) Click on Endo Basic or Epi Basic to launch the respective notebook
4) Run all three cells of code to generate GRN visualization and heatmap visualization
7) Enjoy!

Two pages from the jp_gene_viz repository are particularly helpful for learning how to manipulate the visualizations once they are generated: [GRN control key explanations](https://github.com/simonsfoundation/jp_gene_viz/blob/4e63a1a5adcc5bb5e9148cae964d0048798d9494/doc/dNetwork%20widget%20overview.ipynb) and [heatmap control key explanations](https://github.com/simonsfoundation/jp_gene_viz/blob/4e63a1a5adcc5bb5e9148cae964d0048798d9494/doc/Combined%20widgets.ipynb)
